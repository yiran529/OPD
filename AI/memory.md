## 2026-03-25: Initial OPD training scaffold
- The training pipeline is intentionally explicit and local: `train.py` + `opd/train_loop.py` implement the full loop without framework abstractions.
- Two objectives are supported with config switch:
  - `baseline_ce`: plain next-token CE finetuning.
  - `opd_kl`: rollout-based KL distillation with state alignment.
- In the first OPD implementation, state alignment uses `hidden_states[-1]` on continuation positions as the state representation.
  - This is a deliberate proxy until a stable public recurrent-state interface is exposed by the upstream model.
  - The code fails fast if `hidden_states` are not returned.
- `theta_old` is implemented as a separate frozen rollout model, synchronized every `rollout_sync_steps` optimizer steps.
- FineWeb-Edu data path uses streaming + token packing into fixed-length chunks of `context_len + prefix_len + continuation_len + 1`.
- Checkpoints persist model, rollout model, optimizer, scheduler, scaler, and RNG states for reproducible resume.
