## Overview

**On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD)** trains a single model to act as both student and teacher by conditioning on different contexts — the student sees only the problem, while the teacher additionally sees the ground-truth solution — and performs token-level distribution matching along the student's own on-policy trajectories.


## Updates

- **Mar 18, 2026**: Released updated code. 

  (1) Fixed chat template and zero2 bugs (see [template issue](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/issues/5241)), we re-ran experiments with updated results (detailed results & ablations updated on arxiv/blog). The fixes yield improved OPSD performance, most notably on Qwen3-1.7B.

  (2) Added a new training stabilization strategy 🚀: per-token point-wise KL clipping. We find style tokens (such as 'wait', 'think') can exhibit 6–15× higher KL divergence than math-related tokens, and dominates the training signal. Clipping stablizes training and improves performance.


-  **Mar 3, 2026**: Initial code release.

## Installation


```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate opsd
```

```bash
pip install flash-attn==2.8.3 --no-build-isolation
```
If you encounter difficulties installing flash-attn, you can check the version matching your CUDA and PyTorch versions from the [flash-attention releases page](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases).

The code uses `trl`'s experimental GOLD trainer as a base.

## Quick Start

Reproduce results on Qwen3-1.7B (🚀 training only takes **~15 minutes** on 4×H100 and peaks within 100 steps):

```bash
bash scripts/run_opsd_1b.sh
```
Evaluation: (evaluation takes ~ 30-50 minutes on 4xh100 for each checkpoint) 
```bash
cd eval
bash run_eval.sh
```

## Training


### OPSD

See 

[`scripts/run_opsd_1b.sh`](scripts/run_opsd_1b.sh).
[`scripts/run_opsd_4b.sh`](scripts/run_opsd_4b.sh).
[`scripts/run_opsd_8b.sh`](scripts/run_opsd_8b.sh).

#### Key OPSD arguments

| Argument | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--fixed_teacher` | `False` | Fix the teacher to the initial policy (step 0). Requires --use_peft. Note ❗ If you disable PEFT, the teacher will keep updating at every training step, which may make training unstable. Our main results use the fixed teacher, which is currently implemented with LoRA adapter weights. |
| `--use_tinker_loss` | `False` | Use sampled-token policy-gradient objective instead of full-vocabulary JSD. More memory efficient. Currently no clipped implemented for this variant, could be unstable. |
| `--max_completion_length` | — | Student generation length for distillation. We use 1024 in our main experiments. |
| `--beta` | — | Interpolation weight for the JSD mixture distribution. Beta=0 means forward KL and 1 means reverse KL. |
| `--jsd_token_clip` | 0.05 | Clip the JSD loss for each token to a maximum value. This can improve stability by preventing stylistic tokens from dominating the training signal. | 
| `--reason_first` | `False` | Prepend an explicit rationalization to the teacher context before distillation. |
| `--run_config` | `None` | Custom name suffix for the output directory and WandB run. |

### Acknowledgements
Our implementation builds on [TRL GOLD Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/gold_trainer). We sincerely thank [@simran135](https://github.com/simran135) and [@beanie00](https://github.com/beanie00) for identifying the prompt template bugs and the zero-2 issue, respectively!
